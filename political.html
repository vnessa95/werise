                significant break with the status quo for their district.&nbsp;</strong>We want candidates who take
            major
            leaps forward in one or more of our policy priority areas (see below). This looks different in different

                    that
                    an imperfect candidate could, in some cases, still represent a significant leap forward (see above)
                    by
                    defeating a powerful opponent with a long history of putting the interests of oil and gas executives
                    first. No matter what, we will make this a major demand for general elections and push candidates on
                    this issue.</p>

        <p class="txt"><strong>3. No permanent friends. No permanent
                enemies.&nbsp;</strong> Our only permanent allegiance is to protecting our communities, our shared home,
            and our future. We have to make it clear to politicians that our power and support are earned, and not a
            given. Just because we have supported a candidate in the past doesn’t mean that we will continue to support
            them in the future if there emerges (or the movement puts forth) a viable candidate that is better aligned
            with and more committed to our values and policy priorities.<br><br>
            <span class="endorse"><strong>Note:</strong> Endorsement vs. Support.</span>
            <p class="txt">An endorsement is the public declaration of approval or support for a candidate for elected
                office.
                Sunrise supports all candidates that it endorses. At a minimum, this looks like announcing our support,
                displaying it on our website, and providing in-kind digital communications encouraging the public and
                our supporters to vote for the candidate. We may also support candidates on the ground with people power
                through electoral programs like Sunrise Semester, organize and direct our base to support candidates
                remotely with texting and calling tools, raise money directly for candidates (when legally permissible),
                and/or embed Sunrisers directly with candidates’ campaigns to provide high capacity support (when
                legally permissible). In some cases, Sunrise will also offer our support to candidates we do not
                endorse. This will happen when a candidate does not meet our standards for endorsement (e.g. the
                candidate hasn’t signed the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge), but the candidate’s opponent winning would be
                a completely unacceptable setback to our movement’s goals, and we make a strategic decision to campaign
                against the candidate’s opponent.

                At a national movement-wide level, decisions around support and endorsement are guided by local
                leadership. Hubs are also welcome to make their own decisions and take their own actions around support
                and endorsement guided by the movement’s principles. </p>
